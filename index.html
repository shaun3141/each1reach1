                    <div><i class="small material-icons" style="vertical-align: middle;">location_on</i> <b>Place to look</b></div><br>
                        Some examples of keywords could be "dance studios", "mexican restaurants", "marketing agency", etc. Think about the words you'd use in a google search.<br><br>
                        The only other thing we need is where to look. We'll give you a map of the U.S, you draw a rectangle over the region you're interested in.

                    Once we receive your request, our web servers start working on it immediately.

                        We charge 25 cents per business that we get at least one email from. No more, no less.<br><br>You tell us how many leads you want and we'll start our search. If we get that many leads, we'll charge your card accordingly. If not, we'll only charge it for how many we did end up getting.


                    If a business doesn't have a website or email on their website that we can find, you won't be charged.
